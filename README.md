## Hi, I'm Rangoli Ranjan 👋

I'm a **Healthcare Interoperability Engineer with 6+ years of experience**, currently transitioning into **AI Engineering and Data Science in Healthcare**. I bring deep expertise in **building robust, standards-compliant healthcare integrations** that enable seamless and secure data exchange across complex clinical and operational systems.

Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with **HL7 v2/v3 messaging, FHIR-based APIs, CCD/CCDA documents, and Rhapsody Integration Engine**, ensuring high-quality, reliable interoperability solutions. I am well-versed in healthcare terminologies and standards, including **SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10** allowing me to develop semantically consistent and clinically meaningful systems. My experience also includes mapping and normalizing data between different coding systems to support analytics, reporting, and AI-driven applications.

I have designed and implemented **end-to-end clinical and operational workflows, integrating EHRs, lab systems, PACS, and other healthcare applications** to optimize patient care and streamline hospital operations. My solutions prioritize data integrity, compliance with **HIPAA and global healthcare standards, and real-time clinical usability.**

Currently, I am expanding my expertise into **AI-powered healthcare solutions**, leveraging **Python, cloud platforms, and modern AI frameworks** to develop **GenAI and machine learning applications** that solve real-world clinical and administrative challenges. I focus on **transforming complex healthcare data into actionable insights**, enhancing decision-making for clinicians, and enabling predictive, personalized, and data-driven care.


At healthcare organizations & as Personal Project, I’ve contributed to impactful systems such as:

- 🏥 **Enterprise Healthcare Integration Platform**  
  Designed and maintained HL7 v2 and FHIR-based integrations connecting EMRs, labs, and downstream systems. Improved message reliability and reduced production incidents through robust validation and transformation logic using **Rhapsody + JavaScript**.

- 🔄 **FHIR API Enablement & EMR Interoperability**  
  Implemented FHIR resources and workflows aligned with real-world clinical use cases. Worked on patient, encounter, observation, and document exchange pipelines following interoperability standards.

- 🤖 **AI Agent for Gestational Diabetes Management (In Progress)**  
  Designing an AI-powered companion for Indian pregnancies to support gestational diabetes management. Focused on decision support, personalized insights, and FHIR-aligned data ingestion using **Python, GenAI, and cloud-native architecture**.

- 📊 **Workflow Automation & Data Processing Pipelines**  
  Built automation scripts and data transformation pipelines to reduce manual intervention in healthcare workflows, improving operational efficiency and turnaround times.

I’m passionate about **using AI responsibly in healthcare**, and I enjoy building systems that sit at the intersection of **clinical data, engineering, and intelligence**.
